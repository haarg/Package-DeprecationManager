0.06    2010-10-14

- The -ignore parameter now accepts regular expressions as well as package
  names.


0.05    2010-10-14

- Fixed what looked like a bug in -ignore handling, although I couldn't seem
  to write a test that triggered it.

- Removed hard dep on Test::Warn for the benefit of Moose.


0.04    2010-07-14

- A single feature will now warn more than once if each warning consists of a
  different error message.


0.03    2010-07-14

- Added an -ignore parameter when importing Package::DeprecationManager. This
  lets you explicitly ignore packages in the call stack when determining where
  a deprecated feature was called.


0.02    2010-07-12

- Made it possible to deprecate any feature, not just a subroutine or method.


0.01    2010-07-12

- First release
